# 🌩️ AWS Learning Journey — Documentation & Projects

Welcome to my **AWS Learning Repository**, where I document everything I learn about Amazon Web Services through hands-on, simulated, and documentation-based projects.  
This repo showcases my **cloud fundamentals**, **security knowledge**, **architectural understanding**, and **daily progress**.

---

## 📚 Learning Source

Many of the projects and exercises in this repository are **inspired by guided labs from [NextWork](https://learn.nextwork.org/)**.
All documentation, explanations, diagrams, and notes are written **in my own words** based on what I learned and practiced.
